#AI-Driven Antenna Switching System for 5G Networks

#Project Overview
This project focuses on designing an intelligent antenna switching system for 5G networks using machine learning techniques. The system predicts the optimal antenna or beam based on signal parameters to improve network performance, reduce interference, and enhance throughput.

#Objectives
- Optimize antenna/beam selection in 5G systems
- Improve signal strength and network efficiency
- Reduce latency and unnecessary antenna switching
- Apply machine learning for real-time decision making

#Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Machine Learning Algorithms (Regression / Random Forest / ANN)

#Dataset
The dataset consists of antenna and signal-related parameters such as:
- RSSI / Signal Strength
- Beam Index
- Angle of Arrival
- Frequency Band  
(Data generated using simulation tools / preprocessing methods)

#Methodology
